# random-tools

Scripts and other assets I use for interacting with hardware or processing the data that don't extend over one file.
They only work to the extent that was needed for me, but maybe someone can pick up on the ideas and go further :)

* data-dumpers/saleae-dump.pl: convert csv dumps from Saleae to something useful for further processing
* lab-tools/tti=control.pl: remote control for some TTI power supplies
